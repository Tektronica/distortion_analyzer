<h2>About The Distortion Analyzer</h2>
<p>
The size of the FFT, the length of the window, or the duration of the measurement, should be at least 
six times longer than the period of the signal for a Blackman windowing filter.
</p>
<p>
The lowest detectable frequency by the FFT is determined by the size (duration) of the window. This is 
also considered the bandwidth of the main lobe of the FFT.
</p>
<p>
M is the number of samples captured for a measurement of time series data. M refers to the length of 
the windowing filter applied to the. M≤N where N samples refers to the length of the FFT. When N is 
greater than M, zero padding is employed, which does not introduce new data to the FFT, but only 
increases the resolution of the FFT.
</p>
<p>
Increasing the length of M for a given sample frequency reduces the width of the main lobe. In other 
words, in situations where zero padding is not involved and M=N, the main lobe width is reduced by 
increasing the number of samples for a given sampling frequency.
</p>
<p>
The effective data length of captured period cycles is equal for window shapes where M is scaled "
appropriately.

<p><b>Fluke 8588A Aperture Parameters</b></p>
<p>
The aperture is the duration after each trigger where samples at a rate of 5 MHz are averaged together. 
</p>
<p>
The aperture can be set from 0 ns to 3 ms in 200 ns increments up to 1 ms, and 100 μs increments from 
1 ms to 3 ms.
</p>
<p>
Since the minimum duration to trigger one sample is 200ns, an aperture length greater than 0 ns allows 
more than one sample to be captured and averaged by the digitizer. In a sense, increasing the aperture 
lowers the sampling frequency of the digitizer."
</p>
<p>
The entire process for one reading is 200 ns, which gives a maximum trigger rate of 5 MHz. The aperture 
can be set from 0 ns to 3 ms in 200 ns increments up to 1 ms, and 100 μs increments from 1 ms to 3 ms. 
Greater aperture length decreases sample rate.
