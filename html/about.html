    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The distortion analyzer computes the total harmonic distortion (THD) and total harmonic distortion and noise
        (THD+N) using time series data collected by the Fluke 8588A Digitizer.</p>
    <p>
        The Fluke 8588A digitizer is used to capture the raw data and an FFT is computed and the results of the truncated
        spectrum plotted. Unlike in most analyzer where you specify the number of samples or the sampling frequency,
        the Distortion Analyzer GUI can specify either a relative or absolute mainlobe width.
    </p>
    <p>
       In the image below, an absolute 100 Hz mainlobe width was chosen, which means each peak main-lobe will have a frequency
       resolution of 100 Hz. On the other hand, a relative mainlobe width ensures the mainlobe width scales with the fundamental
       freuqency. So if you specify a relative MLW of 0.1 (units of MLW/Hz), the width operating at 1 kHz is 100Hz. At 5 kHz
       it's 500Hz. Relative MLW is best for computing a consistent (and comparable) total harmonic distortion value.
        However, an absolute MLW is best for RMS measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
    The interface was written in Python and the GUI developed with wxPython, which is a derivative of the wxWidgets library
    in C++.

    <h1 id="steps-for-calculating-distortion">Steps for Calculating Distortion:</h1>
    <h2 id="time-series-data">Time Series Data</h2>
    <p>Time series data is retrieved by the Fluke 8588A digitizer. The digitizer has a fixed sampling frequency of
        <strong>5MHz</strong>, which depending on the frequency of interest, could be considered excessive and drive up
        the number of samples required to appropriately window the time series data. Consequently, specifying an
        aperture length is a way of setting an equivalent sampling frequency lower than 5MHz. The aperture is the
        duration after each trigger where samples at a rate of 5 MHz are averaged together.</p>
    <p>Calculating the appropriate sample length, sampling frequency, and the aperture length requires some
        understanding of windowing that will be discussed in <strong>Sections B and E</strong> in greater detail.</p>
    <p>First the sampling frequency, Fs, is computed by selecting a frequency 100x larger than the fundamental (or
        frequency of interest). Note, an Fs of at least 10x larger than the frequency of interest tends to be a general
        rule of thumb. If the computed Fs is not equal to or larger than twice the specificed bandwidth for the given
        measurement, then twice the measurement bandwidth is chosen by default. However, this value of Fs may not be its
        final value since we still need to have an integer number of samples averaged per measurement by the digitizer
        to resolve this sampling frequency. Consequently, the sampling frequency is calculated twice: once more after
        calculating an integer number of samples to average by the digitizer.</p>

    <pre><code># The digitizer&#39;s sampling frequency
DIGITIZER_SAMPLING_FREQUENCY = 5e6

# Ideal sampling frequency
_Fs = max(2 * bw, 100 * f0)

# An integer number of samples averaged per measurement determines actual sampling frequency
samples_to_average = max(round(DIGITIZER_SAMPLING_FREQUENCY / _Fs), 1)
Fs = DIGITIZER_SAMPLING_FREQUENCY / samples_to_average

samples_to_average = 25 # number of samples collected at digitizing frequency before being averaged
Fs = 200000             # sampling frequency</code></pre>

    <p>Next, the sample length, <strong>N</strong>, is computed by finding the window length of the measurement. An
        error is expressed since the main lobe width is directly proportional to the number of cycles captured. The
        minimum value of <strong>N</strong> correlates to the lowest detectable frequency by the windowing function. For
        instance, blackman requires a minimum of 6 period cycles of the frequency of interest in order to express
        content of that lobe in the DFT. Sampling frequency does not play a role in the width of the lobe, only the
        resolution of the lobe.</p>
    <p>In this example, an error of 10% is specified. For a 1kHz fundamental, the main lobe width will maximally be
        100Hz, the lowest detectable frequency, <strong>ldf</strong>.</p>

    <pre><code>error = 0.1                 # 10%
ldf = f0 * error            # lowest detectable frequency by FFT
M = int(6 * (fs / ldf))     # samples required for window

ldf = 100                   # Hz
M = 12000                   # number of samples</code></pre>

    <p>Finally, the aperture is calculated. For this discussion, however, this won't be covered. Please review <strong>Section
        F</strong> to better understand how to compute the aperture provided the sampling frequency, Fs.</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li><strong>aperture</strong> = max(200e-9 * (samples_to_average - 1), 0) = <strong>4.8us</strong></li>

    <h2 id="windowing-to-reduce-spectral-leakage-of-non-integer-periods">Windowing to reduce spectral leakage of
        non-integer periods</h2>
    <p>The FFT of discrete time series data (DFT) requires an integer number of cycles, otherwise, spectral leakage
        occurs in the form of additional artificial spectral content. Since an FFT assumes an infinite data series
        capable of looping back on itself, a non integer number of cycles (periods) creates a discontinuity between the
        first and last sample and so false harmonics are observed.</p>
    <p>A windowing function aims to mitigate the spectral error associated with data discontinuity by tapering the head
        and tail of the data series to attenuate the effect of the discontinuity. In this example, a blackman window was
        selected since it has greater side lobe attenuation at the cost of wider main lobe width. However, the main lobe
        width is equal to 6/N. That is, at least 6 cycles of the frequency of interest is required to resolve at least
        the frequency of interest and nothing lower. By increasing the sample length, additional cycles are captured,
        which help reduce the main lobe error width. Additional information on windowing can be found in section E
        further down on this page.</p>
    <p>Increasing the length of M for a given sampling frequency reduces the width of the main lobe. In other words, in
        situations where zero padding is not involved and M=N, the main lobe width is reduced by increasing the number
        of samples for a given sampling frequency.</p>

        <img src="static/01_blackman_window.jpg" class="figure"/>
        <div class="figcaption">Fig 6. Blackman Window</div>
    </div>

    <p>The time series data is then multiplied by the window (or convolved in the frequency domain). Tapering at the
        head and tail of the time series data is observed.</p>

    <h2 id="the-fft">The FFT</h2>
    <p>The FFT of the time series data with windowing applied is presented below. The fundamental at 1kHz and two odd
        order harmonics are resolved by the FFT.</p>

        <div class="figcaption">Fig 8. FFT of the Windowed Data</div>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Sampling Theorem</strong></p>
    <p>While the FFT returns spectral content with equal length N to the time series data, the content is composed of
        complex conjugate pairs. Consequently, the FFT only resolves unique-valued spectral content up to only
        approximately half the length of N. As per Nyquist's sampling theorem, the FFT can only resolve spectral content
        up to half the sampling frequency.</p>
    <p><strong>Amplitude Correction</strong></p>
    <p>Since each point of the FFT transform is the result of a sum over a certain time interval of the time-series
        data, the FFT must also be divided by the length of the FFT to appropriately recover the amplitude. In addition,
        since we applied a windowing function to the original data, the amplitude of the the time series data must be
        recovered from the FFT by applying an amplitude correction factor to compensate for the weighting.</p>
    <pre><code>import numpy as np

Fs = 200000 # sampling frequency
N = 12000   # samples collected in measurement

w = np.blackman(N)
amplitude_correction_factor = 1/mean(w)
main_lobe_width = 6 * (Fs / N)

# The one-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform
ytw = yt * w
yf_fft = (np.fft.fft(ytw)) * amplitude_correction_factor

# Calculate length of FFT
if (N % 2) == 0:
    # for even values of N: FFT length is (N / 2) + 1
    fft_length = int(N / 2) + 1
else:
    # for odd values of N: FFT length is (N + 1) / 2
    fft_length = int((N + 2) / 2)

# The one-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform for real input.
yf_rfft = yf_fft[:fft_length]</code></pre>

    <p><strong>Parseval's theorem</strong></p>
    <p>Parseval's Theorem states for discretized signals the total energy of a signal is preserved under the Fourier
        transform, such that:</p>

    <div>
        <img src="static/parseval.png" class="equation"/>
    </div>

    <p>Thus, the total RMS amplitude for the FFT is:</p>

    <pre><code>import numpy as np
import math

def rms(y)
    sqr = np.absolute(y) ** 2
    mean = math.fsum(sqr) / len(sqr)  # computed from partial sums

    return rms</code></pre>

            systems up to a few percent in conventional audio systems). Thus, for this range of THD values, the error caused
            by mixing up the two definitions of THD was acceptable. However, THDF is a much better measure of harmonics
            content. Employment of THDR in measurements may yield high errors in significant quantities such as power-factor

    <h2 id="fluke-8588a-aperture-parameters">Fluke 8588A Aperture Parameters</h2>
    <p>The aperture is the duration after each trigger where samples at a rate of 5 MHz are averaged together.</p>
    <p>The aperture can be set from 0 ns to 3 ms in 200 ns increments up to 1 ms, and 100 μs increments from 1 ms to 3
        ms.</p>
    <p>Since the minimum duration to trigger one sample is 200ns, an aperture length greater than 0 ns allows more than
        one sample to be captured and averaged by the digitizer. In a sense, increasing the aperture lowers the sampling
        frequency of the digitizer.&quot;</p>
    <p>The entire process for one reading is 200 ns, which gives a maximum trigger rate of 5 MHz. The aperture can be
        set from 0 ns to 3 ms in 200 ns increments up to 1 ms, and 100 μs increments from 1 ms to 3 ms. Greater aperture
        length decreases sample rate.</p>
